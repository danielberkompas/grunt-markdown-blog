# grunt-markdown-blog

This is a grunt task for generating static blogs with markdown. It was designed to be used with [Lineman](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman), but should be generally useful to someone trying to accomplish the same.

Here's an example repo that'll be using it. [searls/lineman-blog](https://github.com/searls/lineman-blog)
